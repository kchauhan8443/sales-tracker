# sales-tracker is an app that is used to manage daily businesses activities, using sales  books
The books can either be public or private
For pulic books, it is where you want to share information with other people
The app is entirely developed in express,as the routing framework, passport as the authenciating strategy, and hbs as the templating engine
I have also used moment for dates, method-override to enable update and delete.
